A basic client-side weather app example.
Uses the Open Weather Map API to request weather data.



WORKSHOP
IDEA - Let's make a super simple weather appplication that runs on the web. You type in the name of a city and get the current temperature for that city.


Ingredients
To make this application, we're going to need to cover the following topics:

HTML - the information represented on the page
CSS - the style or look of the information
Javacsript - the programming language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage
API (Application Programming Interface) - where and how we get the weather data
JSON - the weather data
jQuery - a javascript library that makes web programming a bit easier for us
